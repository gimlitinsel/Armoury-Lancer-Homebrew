It might be a bit too cute but it’s the name our cask spat out for us.\nWe observed Didymos Prime in action during the fall of Green Zone Alhambra, mounted in a chassis we initially\nclassified as a HORUS Minotaur, one of three we ID’d operating among the Ungrateful cell in New Madrassa.\nIt was not that Minotaur.\nAlhambra fell in three days. A spirited resistance, but they decided to cut their losses and pull back. Their new\ncommander is a smart one. We moved in after, during the looting. Our local contact [NAME REDACTED] escorted us\nto the NM commanders, introduced us to them, and secured an audience with the pilot of the chassis.\nI’m sure you’ve reviewed the records of the debrief we recorded. We don’t know how it arrived in New Madrassa; the\nUngratefuls say they received the initial code burst from their contact in the Voladores. The Voladores say they never\ngave them anything, and called it la pulga, “The Flea” — we have designated it LITCH. Didymos is the active animus\n— what serves as its pilot.\nWe do not recommend giving this one a long leash.",
