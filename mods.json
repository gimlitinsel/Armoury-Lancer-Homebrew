    "effect": "Choose one melee weapon. After hitting a character with an attack from this weapon, your mech takes 1 heat and this weapon creates a cone 3 blast originating from your target that must be placed on the opposite side. If applied to a weapon that hits multiple targets, this effect only functions on the primary target. Characters caught in this blast take 2 explosive damage. The main target does not take this damage.",

    "description": "Redirecting spare reactor power down cabling extending to a melee weapon was an ingenious but foolhardy innovation. The resultant weapon is so hot that on impact it vaporizes parts of its targets internal systems, creating a secondary blast cloud of debris."
