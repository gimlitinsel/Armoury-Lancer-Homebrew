    "description": "The ZHENG is a relatively new frame in the IPS-N line and is unusual in that its creation can be attributed almost completely to a single mech operator - Haoyi Mei, a Mirrorsmoke mercenary operating out of the Long Rim, protecting Armory shipments of supplies to the early Dawnline shore colonies. A relative unknown before the incident, her convoy was attacked by the White Tiger pirate conglomerate and her entire company was KIA.<br>Haoyi’s Raleigh was almost totally ripped apart in the ensuing chaos, but she managed to activate a distress beacon and attach it to her mech. Over the next forty five days she survived by scavenging the collapsing and melting wreck of the huge transport ship M.S. Say No More, managing to outsmart the fifty or so pirates searching for her by steadily modifying her mech for unarmed, CQB combat. In an tight, close environment where the ship’s decaying reactor core made combustible ranged weapons incredibly dangerous, she showed incredible efficacy and ingenuity. Haoyi did not survive, persisting hours before the relief fleet arrived, but bought enough time that MSMC was able to position itself to both resupply the colony, fulfilling its contract, and deal a mortal blow to the Tigers, wiping the pirates out completely in the following skirmishes. Her mech was purchased by IPS-N frame development and the Zheng was introduced shortly afterwards based on her improvements.<br>Haoyi is widely regarded as a Bodhisattva by many Long Rim colonists and nearly all MSMC mercs are familiar with the several drinking games named after her.",

Distortions of this kind are short lived, usually (but not always) visible to the naked eye, and highly unstable.

The progeny of a long refinement period and utilizing the bleeding edge of reactor miniaturization tech, the mech was finally condensed down to something resembling a large, sleek hard suit, almost skin-tight at points. Though sacrificing much of the durability of a larger frame, the mech’s essential system are so closely melded with its user’s movements that it offers unparalleled agility.<br> Though originally tightly licensed for select clientele, the Atlas was introduced to the Sparri almost by mistake when a mercenary in the Long Rim won the frame in a game of kapkat. Since then, demand from the Sparri has been so strong that SSC was forced to reconsider its licensing scheme. Considered perfect warrior frames for hunting the native megafauna of Sparr, they are now widely perceived as the iconic frames of Sparri headhunters and daredevils across the Orion Arm, to the point that the Sparri invented a new martial art using the Atlas.<br> Considered heirlooms of great warriors, they are passed down through bloodlines and often repaired and modified manually. The suit’s powerful systems remember the unique movements of all that have worn it before, enabling Sparri hunters to literally call upon their ancestors in battle.",
