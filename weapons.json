Originally rigged as a last resort by it’s operator, this fist-mounted weapon is essentially a redirection of the mechs’ core reactor. It must be primed before firing, requiring a dangerous power draw from the mechs’ systems and creating an enormous amount of emissions. The weapons’ first firing killed Haoyi Mei and five of her opponents, and its tendency to cause enormous collateral damage and its spectacular discharge when fired earned it the moniker ‘Shā mǎ zhǎng’ or Horse Killing Palm.",
